\section{Mitigating the Unstable Feedback}

- Looks like it is not result from electrical circuit, as no distinct resonances were  found. The fact that feedback freq depends on what we use to couple the mic to stethoscope suggests an acoustic resonance is the cause. Further work could be undertaken to place sound absorbing materials around the microphone, such as silicon or a porous fibre, in order to minimise the amount of feedback sound entering the microphone from directions other than the stethoscope diaphragm. 

- feedback issue, what's the best way to resolve it? \\
	- maybe capacitive and laser sensor would not have this feedback issue
	- could use digital filter to create notch filter
	- could use difference amplifier at input, with one microphone outside and another inside the stethoscope. That way it only subtracts the feedback freq leaving the signal.
	- Alternatively a phase lock loop could be used
