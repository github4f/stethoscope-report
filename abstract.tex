\chapter*{Abstract}

In this project we designed and built an electronic stethoscope capable of transmitting sounds wirelessly to a Blue tooth speaker. A microphone attached to the head of a conventional stethoscope was used to pick up heart and lung sounds, and electrical circuits were designed and produced to extract and transmit this signal. Using the device proved problematic with respect to audio feedback, as the microphone picked up particular frequencies from the speaker in an unstable manner. We showed through the use of a notch filter that this feedback could be eliminated, making the device usable. Further work to improve the device is discussed for use in any future projects.
