@article{laserMic,
Abstract = {The article discusses a method of eavesdropping based upon the modulation of laser light reflected from a window pane. It describes a simple and affordable classroom demonstration of a laser microphone. The demonstration requires a classroom helium-neon laser, an audio amplifier and a speaker. It cites the advantages of using a freestanding piece of window glass for the demonstration.},
