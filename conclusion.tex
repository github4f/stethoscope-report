\chapter{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

In conclusion our wireless stethoscope is capable of picking up heart beat sounds, but requires the use of a notch filter to prevent unstable feedback. This feedback occurs at frequencies that also contain the heart and lung sounds of interest, and so regardless of how precise the notch filter can be developed the solution is not ideal as some portion of the desired signal is necessarily lost. Further work needs to be done to study the cause of the feedback instability, which we showed to be unrelated to the electrical components of our system, and instead propose that it arises from acoustic resonances in either the diaphragm or tubing. 

Our device can couple to a Blue tooth enabled speaker that is possible to hear while wearing the isolation suit, and does not require the use of an ear piece. A metric needs to be developed to measure the quality of sound transmitted by the stethoscope, which would require further collaboration with practising doctors or medical students, to determine the sound characteristics they listen for when performing auscultations.
